# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Core Optimizations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present — all design decisions were previously discussed and documented in the implementation plan (summary.md).
- 4 user stories cover all optimization areas: multi-instruction execution (P1), model routing (P2), batch operations (P2), and memory management (P3).
- 10 functional requirements map to all 7 technique areas from the plan.
- 6 success criteria are all measurable and technology-agnostic.
